1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,679
Alright, we're here in

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:03,359
Williamsburg, Iowa and

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:05,040
uh, what is this thing?

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,919
Brickhouse coffee and the

5
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:08,800
mocha?

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,800
Not much to say.

7
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,740
It's exactly the same

8
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,679
thing as I would make.

9
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,219
Like, it could be out of

10
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:14,759
my same especial machine.

11
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:15,759
True or false?

12
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,260
That is what you have

13
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,760
noted.

14
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,760
Yeah, sorry about that.

15
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,760
This I don't know.

16
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,760
Yeah, well it's true.

17
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,660
They really went ham on

18
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,160
the chocolate sauce and

19
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,660
so it's a like 6 out of

20
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,160
10.

21
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,560
It's like, yeah.
